## About this Repository
This repo includes both a GUI and local script to handle adding PDF page links to the TTRPG BREAK!!'s sourcebook.
<br>It uses PyMuPDF and Regex to search for any occurrences of the format pXXX and adds a relevant page link from that text section.

## Note on Anti-Virus Catching
It is a common occurrence that anti-viruses mistakenly flag Python executable programs that were compiled with PyInstaller as malicious software.<br> More information on this can be found <a href="https://github.com/hankhank10/false-positive-malware-reporting">here</a>.
